# Lunatic Rave 3
Lunatic Rave 3 is an open source and cross-platform alternative to the popular BMS player Lunatic Rave 2.

## why
Lunatic Rave 2, developed by lavalse, was last updated in 2010. The program is riddled with minor bugs, memory leaks related to most of its features, and an undisclosed security critcial bug allowing arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted BMS header file. Despite its abandonware status, Lunatic Rave 2 remains the most popular software for playing BMS. This project indends to fix all known bugs, retain all gameplay elements from LR2, and provide features for a better end user experience.

## features?

- full support for custom resolutions
